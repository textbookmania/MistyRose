The app is initialized with a listing of textbooks used in the ICS curriculum, as well as a few buying and selling offers. \r\n\r\nUsers of this app are able to:\r\n * *Sell a textbook:* Users can put up an offer to sell their textbook, given that it exists in the directory of textbooks.\r\n * *Buy a textbook:* Users can make an offer to buy a textbook that is on the list of books in the app.\r\n * *Contact potential buyers/sellers:* Users that opt to be contacted may be contacted by other users to complete the textbook exchange.\r\n\r\n# Quick Start\r\n*Note:* Before diving into the application, you may want to familiarize yourself with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/).\r\n\r\n* Download the latest version of the application at: https://github.com/textbookmania/MistyRose\r\n\r\n* Invoke the application for the first time using:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmeteor --settings ../config/settings.development.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n* In production, use\r\n\r\n```\r\nmeteor --settings ../config/settings.production.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Note:* The settings file is needed to provide CAS parameter information.
