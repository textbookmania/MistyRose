#Usage
Invoke the application for the first time using:

```
meteor --settings ../config/settings.development.json
```

In production, use

```
meteor --settings ../config/settings.production.json
```

The settings file is needed to provide CAS parameter information. Note that you won't be able to successfully login until you edit the settings.development.json file to indicate that your UH account should be one of those allowed to login.
